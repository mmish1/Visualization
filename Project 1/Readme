Aim: To parse the data from a CSV file and implement the following using d3.js:
1.	Binning the variables in the data into a fixed range. 
2.	Creating a bar chart of the variables picked above.
3.	Allowing users to select another variable from the menu to update the chart.
4.	Display the values on top of the bar only on mouse-over.
5.	Making the selected bar wider and higher on mouse-over.
6.	On mouse-click, transforming the bar graph into a pie chart and back.
7.	Increasing/Decreasing bar graph width when mouse moves right/left.

CSV File chosen: The file has data on the 248 largest Canadian firms with publicly available information in the mid-1970s. Information 
is given about the assets owned by the companies (in millions of USD), the industrial sector it falls into, country of ownership and 
the number of interlocking director and executive positions shared with other major firms.
